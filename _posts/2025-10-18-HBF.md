Here in Blacksburg, Virginia, we had the opportunity to represent the [Vinauger lab](https://www.vinaugerlab.com/) and the [Lahondere Lab](https://www.chloelahondere.com/) at two major events designed to share and promote our research.

The first was the [Hokie BugFest](https://www.ento.vt.edu/4-H_Entomology/hokiebugfest.html), a family-friendly event celebrating insects and entomology, organized by the Virginia Tech Department of Entomology.

The second event was [Hokie for a Day](https://ceni.icat.vt.edu/programs/hokie-for-a-day-expo.html), an exhibition of Virginia Tech labs to fifth-grade students. It gives young learners an opportunity to discover university life and understand the relevance of our research.

I believe that these events are an essential part of our mission to make science accessible and engaging for the public, and trying to spark curiosity in future generations. It is also a very cool exercise to manipulate your topic, and a funny and rewarding experience !
