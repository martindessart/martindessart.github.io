On the 9th of March 2021, I participated in the radio program on France Culture [The Scientific Method](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/la-methode-scientifique).
This was an exciting experience to present my work there. You can find the replay [here](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/la-methode-scientifique/ecologie-de-la-peur-loup-y-es-tu-5123889). My intervention starts at 40 min 18 sec.
