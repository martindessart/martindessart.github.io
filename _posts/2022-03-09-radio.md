I presented my PhD research on France Culture's radio program [The Scientific Method](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/la-methode-scientifique).
It was an exciting opportunity to share my work with a broader audience. The replay is available [here](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/la-methode-scientifique/ecologie-de-la-peur-loup-y-es-tu-5123889). My intervention starts at 40 min 18 sec.
