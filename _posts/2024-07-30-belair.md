In the summer of 2022, we gave a talk of scientific vulgarisation with Dr Sylvie Guillerme and Constance Chourauand had a stand at the [Bel Air Festival](https://belairfestival.fr/engagements/). This regional festival combines music, art and reflection on current issues related to our consumption patterns and discoveries on biodiversity in the Pyrenees. At this conference, we also presented the results of our first paper {% cite dessart2024color %} .
