On October 7th, 2023, I participated in the [Fête de la Science](https://www.inrae.fr/fete-de-la-science-2023). Together with [Clement Gasque](https://www.instagram.com/clement.gasque/), we merged science and art through innovative technology. Here's how it all came together:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/B5_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/B5_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

</div>

- During my PhD, I used a Raspberry Pi device, paired with a camera, to record the behavior of larvae in response to different stimuli.

- I then employed an algorithm to track the locomotor activity of several individuals.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/B5_V1.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/B5_V2.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>

- When I shared my work-in-progress with Clement, he had the brilliant idea of transforming my data into 3D prints that visualized the behavior of each individual.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/B5_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- We then created unique "postcards" from the 3D models, which we printed live during the event and handed out to the children who attended.

It was a fantastic experience, blending science with creativity in a way that was both fun and engaging!

    </div>
