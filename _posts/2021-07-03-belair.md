On the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of July 2021, we hosted a stand and gave a public presentation about my master's project with Dr [Sylvie Guillerme](https://geode.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil/personnel/sylvie-guillerme) and Constance Chourau at the [Bel Air Festival](https://belairfestival.fr/souvenirs). This regional event blends music, art and discussions on current issues related to our consumption patterns and biodiversity in the Pyrenees. During the conference, we also presented the results of our first paper {% cite dessart2024color %}h.
