On the 16th of March 2022, I participated to [MT180](https://mt180.fr/). The Three Minute Thesis Competition (in French ‘Ma thèse en 180 secondes’) aims to promote public understanding of science at the level of doctoral studies. Participants present their research project to a non-specialist, non-scientific and highly diverse audience. The challenge is to give a clear, concise and convincing presentation using simple terms, images and metaphors, all shown on a single slide in just three minutes.
