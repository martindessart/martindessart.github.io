In November 2025, I traveled to Portland, Oregon, to attend [Entomology 2025](https://entomology2025.eventscribe.net/) organized by the [Entomological Society of America](https://entsoc.org/). Together with Sydney Luff, I had the pleasure of meeting new people, attending great talks and sharing our work on how mosquitoes avoid visual danger, and how activity patterns vary across local populations.
