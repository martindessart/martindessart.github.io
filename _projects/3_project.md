From July to November 2020, I worked at the CRCA in Toulouse, France, under the supervision of Sylvie Guillerme and Martin Giurfa.

**Resume of our project**

**Invasive plants** represent a significant global challenge as they **compete** with **native plants** for limited resources such as space, nutrients and pollinators. Here, we focused on four invasive species that are widely spread in the **French Pyrenees**, Buddleja davidii, Reynoutria japonica, Spiraea japonica and Impatiens glandulifera, and analyzed their **visual advertisement signals** with respect to those displayed by their surrounding native species using a **perceptual approach** based on the **neural mechanisms** of **bee vision** given that bees are regular pollinators of these plants. We collected 543 spectral reflections from the 4 invasive species, and 66 native species and estimated **achromatic and chromatic similarities** to the bee eye.

R. japonica, S. japonica and B. davidii were **inconspicuous** against the foliage background and could be **hardly discriminated** in terms of color from their surrounding native plants. These characteristics promote **generalization**, potentially attracting pollinators foraging on similar native species. Two morphs of I. glandulifera were both **highly salient** in chromatic and achromatic terms and different from their surrounding native species. This distinctive identity facilitates **detection** and **learning** in association with rich nectar. While visual signals are not the only sensory cue accounting for invasive-plant success, our study reveals new elements for understanding biological invasion processes from the perspective of pollinator perceptual processes.
