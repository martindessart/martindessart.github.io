From July to November 2020, I worked at the CRCA in Toulouse, France, under the supervision of Sylvie Guillerme and Martin Giurfa. While COVID was spreading around in 2020, we were lucky enough to go to the Pyrenees to sample the reflectance of flowers. We then used a perceptual approach based on the neural mechanisms of bee vision to compare different properties of local flowers with invasive flowers. We found out that if you're an invasive flower, you can hide among local flowers, promoting bees generalization, or you can be very conspicuous and potentially attract more pollinators. In this work, we focused on visual cues, but invasive plants use multiple sensory dimensions, so this work is now followed by the thesis of [Frank Weber](https://theses.fr/s312048)

**Resume of our project**

**Invasive plants** represent a significant global challenge as they **compete** with **native plants** for limited resources such as space, nutrients and pollinators. Here, we focused on four invasive species that are widely spread in the **French Pyrenees**, Buddleja davidii, Reynoutria japonica, Spiraea japonica and Impatiens glandulifera, and analyzed their **visual advertisement signals** with respect to those displayed by their surrounding native species using a **perceptual approach** based on the **neural mechanisms** of **bee vision** given that bees are regular pollinators of these plants. We collected 543 spectral reflections from the 4 invasive species, and 66 native species and estimated **achromatic and chromatic similarities** to the bee eye.

R. japonica, S. japonica and B. davidii were **inconspicuous** against the foliage background and could be **hardly discriminated** in terms of color from their surrounding native plants. These characteristics promote **generalization**, potentially attracting pollinators foraging on similar native species. Two morphs of I. glandulifera were both **highly salient** in chromatic and achromatic terms and different from their surrounding native species. This distinctive identity facilitates **detection** and **learning** in association with rich nectar. While visual signals are not the only sensory cue accounting for invasive-plant success, our study reveals new elements for understanding biological invasion processes from the perspective of pollinator perceptual processes.
