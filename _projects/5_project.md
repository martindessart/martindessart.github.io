From March 2021 to May 2021, I co-supervised Tristan Robineau, a Master 1 intern, at the Insect Biology Research Institute, Tours, France. The objective of his internship was to measure the effects of light and turbidity on the habituation learning of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito larvae. His internship was successfully defended.

**Resume of our project**

**Luminosity** and **turbidity** are two factors influencing **visibility**. In this study, we focused on the potential impact of luminosity and turbidity on **sensory** and **cognitive**skills in **Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae**. In order to do this, we applied a **habituation protocol**, in which a square of cardboard was presented at regular interval under a light, thus projecting its shadow (visual stimulus) on the larva. We individually trained several larvae reared under different luminosity and turbidity conditions; (1) larvae raised in **light** and **clear water**; (2) larvae raised in **light** and **turbid water**; (3) larvae raised in **darkness** and **clear water**; (4) larvae raised in **darkness** and **turbid water**. Larvae were trained in clear or turbid water. Statistical analyses showed that **rearing conditions** did not influence neither the **level** nor the **dynamics** of **learning**. Moreover, the physical conditions of the environment did not modify the sensory skills in the assayed larvae.
