During my PhD, I presented my first poster at the 15th [Ecology & Behavior](https://ecobhv15.sciencesconf.org/) meeting in Strasbourg in 2022. This conference was organized by PhD students from my master's cohort, who combined excellent organisation with a friendly touch, so I enjoyed very much to come back to this city.
