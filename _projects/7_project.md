During my PhD, I presented a first poster during the 15th meeting Ecology & Behavior at Strasbourg in 2022.
This conference was organised by PhD students from my master that mastered the organisation with a friendly touch, so I enjoyed very much to come back to this city.

This poster is associated with this paper: {% cite dessart2023assessing %}
