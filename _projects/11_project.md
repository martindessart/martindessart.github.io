In November 2025, I had the opportunity to present our ongoing research at the [Vinauger Lab](https://www.vinaugerlab.com/) on the effect of light shifts on mosquito synchronization at the [Animal Behaviour Live online conference](https://ablaoc25.sciencesconf.org/). This international organization host scientific conferences with a fair representation of self-assessed minorities, geographical distribution of speakers and democratically decision-making.
