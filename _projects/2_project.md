From January to June 2020, I had the privilege of working at Animal Mind Lab in Christchurch, New Zealand, under the supervision of Dr [Alex Taylor](https://www.animalmindslab.com/) and [Dr Amalia Bastos](https://apmbastos.wordpress.com/). For three month, our work was based at the Kea aviary of the [Willowbank Wildlife Reserve](https://www.willowbank.co.nz/), an amazing place dedicated to conservation effort in New Zealand. This experience allowed us to engage in public education and advocate for wildlife conservation.

**Resume of our project**

How important is the link between **vocalisations** and internal **emotional states**? Emotional state influences cognition by three types of **cognitive biases**: attention, memory and judgment biases. The **judgment bias test (JBT)** has been introduced to measure animals’ own judgment as an indicator of their emotional state and welfare.

Here, we created a paradigm using a **visual JBT** where we tested the effect of two vocalisations (warble call as a **playful call**, hence **“positive-valenced”** and **trill call** as an alarm call, hence **“negative valenced”**) on 8 kea (Nestor notabilis). For this experiment, kea were trained to distinguish the presentation of a positive (rewarding) or a negative (non-rewarding) cue, and then tested on novel **ambiguous** to probe their judgment of them. Simultaneously with the introduction of each ambiguous cue, kea heard a **playback** of a vocalisation.

We measured the **latency to approach** the cue for one positive, one negative and three types of ambiguous cues, using colored flap doors (0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% grey) and a specific apparatus. Using **Bayesian multilevel analysis**, we did not find strong differences in latency between the two vocalisations conditions. Yet, kea showed a **remarkable learning capacity** and **good consistency** throughout the experiment.

Despites the unpredictable behavioural inter-individual differences of kea, this study provides robust support to set up JBT test on Psittacidae and calls for the analysis of animal welfare through the lens of animal emotional state as a support of other most commonly used tests.
