In 2023, I presented a second poster at the 52nd meeting of the French Society for the Study of Animal Behaviour (SFECA).

This poster is associated with this preprint: {% cite Preprint2025 %}

This conference holds a special place in my heart, as it was hosted in Tours, where I was pursuing my PhD.
It provided a wonderful opportunity to connect with PhD students from other labs, and we made the most of the beautiful weather by playing pétanque, a pastime I greatly enjoy.
On a more professional note, this week was filled with inspiring discussions and exciting talks on animal behaviour.
