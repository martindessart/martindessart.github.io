From April to June 2019, I had the opportunity to work at the MARBEC lab in Montpellier, France, under the supervision of Dr Jean-Christophe Auguet and Dr Marie-Charlotte Cheutin.

The project aimed to explore a fascinating question: Does the **gut microbiota** of fish significantly contribute to total **CH₄ production**?

Our first goal was to assess the **abundance and diversity of methanogenic archaea** in the fish microbiota using **PCR analysis**.

Additionally, we measured **CH₄ emissions from fish** collected in the Mediterranean Sea using **gas chromatography** and **mass detection**.

Although my short internship yielded only preliminary results and a prototype, it was an amazing experience to discover microbiology methods, participate in fieldwork collecting fish, and participate in a large project.
