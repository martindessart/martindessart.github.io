From April to June 2019, I worked at the MARBEC lab in Montpellier, France, under the supervision of Jean-Christophe Auguet and Marie-Charlotte Cheutin.

The main question of the project was: Does the gut microbiota of fish make a significant contribution to total CH4 production?

Our first objective was to measure the abundance and diversity of methanogenic archaea in the fish microbiota using PCR analysis.
Then, we also measured the CH4 emitted by fish we collected in the Mediterranean Sea.
Although my short internship was not concluding, it was an amazing experience to discover microbiology methods, collect fish and participate in a large project.
