From april to june 2019, I worked at the MARBEC Lab in Montpellier, France, under the supervision of Jean-Christophe Auguet and Marie-Charlotte Cheutin.

The global question of the project was: Does the gut microbiota of fish make a significant contribution to total CH4 production?

Our first goal was to measure the abundance and diversity of methanogenous archea in fishes microbiota using PCR analysis.
Then, we also measured the CH4 emitted by fishes that we collected in the mediterranean sea.
Although my short internship was not concluding, it was an astonishing experience to discover microbiology methods, collect fishes and participate in a large project.
