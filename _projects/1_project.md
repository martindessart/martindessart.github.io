From April to June 2019, I worked at the [MARBEC](https://umr-marbec.fr/) in Montpellier, France, under the supervision of Dr Jean-Christophe Auguet and Dr Marie-Charlotte Cheutin.

The project aimed to explore a fascinating question: to what extend does the **gut microbiota** of fish significantly contribute to overall **CH₄ production**?

Our first goal was to characterize the **abundance and diversity of methanogenic archaea** in the fish microbiota using **PCR-based analyses**.

Additionally, we measured **CH₄ emissions from fishes** collected in the Mediterranean Sea using **gas chromatography** coupled with **mass detection**.

Although my short internship yielded only preliminary results and a prototype, it was an amazing experience to learn microbiology techniques, participate in fish sampling fieldwork, and contribute to a large-scale research project.
