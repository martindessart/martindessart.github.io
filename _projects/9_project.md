During my two-month internship at AVA (Agir pour la Vie Animale), I assisted the staff of the farm refuge, which provides care for animals with complex backgrounds. I also assisted Dr Marine Parker by participating in a protocol from [her PhD research](https://theses.fr/2018STRAJ126) exploring biological rhythms in cats. This first hands-on research experience provided me valuable insights into fieldwork and questions related to the effect of Zeitgebers such as photoperiod, on animal rhythms.
I gained also practical experience using telemetry devices like GPS and RFID to monitor daily food consumption and locomotor activity. Additionally, I had the privilege to meet very inspiring individuals like Prof [Bertrand Deputte](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bertrand-Deputte-2) and [Brunilde Ract-Madoux](https://comportementduchat.fr/), as well as working alongside wonderful colleagues that dedicate their work to taking care of animals.

Finally, I fell in love with Mimine, a cat from the refuge. So here are some pictures of herâ€”she's truly special.
