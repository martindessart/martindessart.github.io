During my two-month internship at AVA (Agir pour la Vie Animale), I assisted the staff of the animal shelter, which provides care for animals with complex backgrounds. I also assisted Dr Marine Parker by participating in a protocol from [her PhD research](https://theses.fr/2018STRAJ126) exploring biological rhythms in domestic cats. This first hands-on research experience provided me valuable insights into fieldwork logistics and into questions related to the impact of environmental cues, such as light-dark cycles, on animal rhythms.
I also gained practical experience with telemetry devices like GPS and RFID to monitor daily food consumption and locomotor activity. Additionally, I had the privilege to meet inspiring biologists like Prof [Bertrand Deputte](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bertrand-Deputte-2) and [Brunilde Ract-Madoux](https://comportementduchat.fr/), as well as working alongside wonderful colleagues that dedicate their time to improve the life of animals.

Finally, I formed a special bond with Mimine, a cat from the refuge. So here are some pictures of her — she's truly special.
