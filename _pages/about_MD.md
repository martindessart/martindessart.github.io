I am a `neuroethologist` passionate about `animal cognition`, with a particular focus on insects.

Despite their tiny brains, these creatures exhibit remarkable behavioural adaptations relying on their complex sensory systems to perceive, process, and respond to diverse cues from their environment.
My academic journey began with an `engineering degree` from ICAM Toulouse, followed by a `Master's degree` from the University of Strasbourg. I then pursued a `PhD` at the University of Tours, under the guidance of Prof. Claudio Lazzari and Dr. Fernando Guerrieri.  

My PhD work focused on the cognitive abilities of mosquito larvae, exploring how environmental `pollutants` impact their `learning and memory` and how these creatures can serve as `biological indicators` of freshwater ecosystem health.
Now as a `postdoc associate` in `Virginia Tech's Vinauger Lab`, I am studying `mosquito behaviour and cognition`, and the underlying mechanisms that makes these insects so highly effective at bothering us!
